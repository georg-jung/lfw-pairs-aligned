# Aligned Face Images from LFW's pairs.txt

This repository contains `jpg`s with aligned face images from LFW listed in pairs.txt.

## Source

* <https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/vision/body_analysis/arcface#dataset>
* `lfw.bin` file from <https://s3.amazonaws.com/onnx-model-zoo/arcface/dataset/faces_ms1m_112x112.zip>

The aligned images from `lfw.bin` are extracted and restructured in LFW's original folder structure. Thus, you can use LFW's original `pairs.txt` file and process just the images listed there.
